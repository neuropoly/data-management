# Neuropoly Data Management

This repository deals with dataset usage and maintenance at [NeuroPoly Lab](https://www.neuro.polymtl.ca).

We run an [internal server](./internal-server.md) so private datasets can be kept off the public internet.

We have have general experience [tracking neuroimaging data with git-annex](./git-annex.md).
